"What do you like best about AKOOL?Ease of use / Simplicity. Clean User interface and generally quick processing times with good results. Good image generator which is also simple to use for high quality image generation. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about AKOOL?This has happened a few times - if there are too many user using the service - your generation can take some to output. On very rare occasions it can fail. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems is AKOOL solving and how is that benefiting you?I am a content creator. I have used Deepfake tech. since the days of Deepfacelab when you required a powerful GPU and a couple of days to generate Faceswaps. I was introduced to Akool via a Cinecom video. With Akool the Faceswaps generated with just a single image are very impressive. Processing times are generally very fast. What used to take days now takes a couple of seconds or minutes at the most (depending on the length of your shot). I first used Akool to create a Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Deepfake trailer starring Shahrukh Khan - https://youtu.be/N98eAQ6K8PY

Faceswapping by traditional methods would have been cumbersome and time consuming. Akool made it very straightforward. So I could finish doing the trailer much faster than what it would have taken otherwise.

More recently I used Akool's Beyond for image generation. Using the correct prompts I could utilise it for generating a consistent and realistic looking character. When Runway would generate the video out of the still image generated by Akool - the character in the generated video could lose its facial details over time. So, I used Akool's Faceswap to get the character face back in. The results are pretty good and quite a few people had asked me how I managed to get a consistent character in my AI generated video. Bear in mind this was done in March,2024 before Midjourney introduced consistent character generation. Also in the same film I used Akool for video dubbing - easily translating and syncing to 5 languages. In case you would like to see the film - it's called Tamara and is available for viewing here - https://youtu.be/S-Glm9JdvrI

So in a nutshell Akool helped out a lot in bringing my creative vision to life. Without it - the videos above would not have been possible to make. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.",5.0,2024-04-27,Anshul J.
