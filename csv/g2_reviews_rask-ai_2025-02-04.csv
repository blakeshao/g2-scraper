"What do you like best about Rask AI?1. Winning by far against other dubbing AIs by offering the option to edit speech. The translation of a word doesn't always come out as we wish, this happens on other platforms too, and with RASK.AI you have the possibility to edit the words and correct if any word came out wrong.  2. Unlike another AI, the minutes do not expire. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about Rask AI?1. Lipsync is only available in pro mode. It would be nice if it were available from the Basics mode.2. The option to add STR is also not available in Basics mode. It should be because Pro mode is not interesting for me yet, as I use it for a few minutes and that should not be a reason not to have the best tools.3. The Portuguese language sometimes mixes with Portuguese from Portugal. There should be an option for Brazilian Portuguese and another option for Portuguese from Portugal. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems is Rask AI solving and how is that benefiting you?With Rask.IA, we can have more than one profile in different languages, reaching diverse cultures and countries as well.

"What do you like best about Rask AI?After exploring HeyGen, I stumbled upon Rask AI, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations. Rask AI stands out with its superior features, advanced stage of development, and remarkable stability. The user interface is exceptionally intuitive, making the entire process ultra-easy for me. As someone actively involved in producing translations, I was pleasantly surprised by the seamless experience and minimal effort required.

One notable advantage is the competitive pricing, especially when compared to other services offering a similar range of features. What truly impressed me was the swift export time. Unlike HeyGen, where exporting a one-minute final video took over 30 minutes, RASK AI accomplished the task in less than a minute—truly amazing!

I've particularly appreciated RASK's proficiency in handling technical and specialized language commonly found in online courses. The translations consistently maintain accuracy and a natural tone, significantly enhancing my learning experience by allowing me to follow along in my preferred language.

The user-friendly interface of RASK's web app deserves special mention. Uploading course materials for translation is a breeze, and RASK takes care of the rest. Whether downloading the translated files or viewing them directly in the app, the process is seamless.

In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend RASK to anyone in need of translating online courseware. It's a robust and versatile tool that has not only simplified but also enriched my language learning journey, making it both enjoyable and highly effective. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about Rask AI?On a few occasions, I encountered a notable issue with RASK. There were instances where the English dub version lacked emotional depth, which was surprising considering that the Spanish version, sharing the same original audio track, performed much better in terms of conveying emotions. This inconsistency in emotional expression across language versions was a drawback that impacted the overall viewing experience. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems is Rask AI solving and how is that benefiting you?One significant concern I faced with RASK was primarily related to the time and cost associated with translating into less common languages, such as Chinese in my specific case. The process of translation, especially for non-mainstream languages, appeared to be more time-consuming and costly compared to translations into widely spoken languages like English. This aspect posed a challenge, particularly when dealing with less common language pairs, impacting the efficiency and overall affordability of the translation service.

Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about Rask AI?I prefer changing language accents without using all my allocated paid minutes. At least have the opportunity change one time. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems is Rask AI solving and how is that benefiting you?As a content creator, I have been utilizing Rask to translate my English videos into Spanish through the inclusion of a Spanish voiceover.

"What do you like best about Rask AI?I used Rask to translate 18 episodes of a podcast from the original Italian. I cloned my own voice and used ""library voices"" for all the other people involved. The result is amazing. My cloned voice sounds like my own voice (with a better accent). I think there's still room for improvement but i would use it again. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about Rask AI?You really have to check and edit the translation made by AI, because sometimes is quite disappointing. AI tends to translate literally, so you have to be careful if you don't want a very weird version. Another issue is that sometimes the interpretation is quite robotic (but it gets much better if you add a lot of punctuation in the written text). Last but not least, if your video is 30 second long, you pay for a whole minute, which is not fair. Brief, there is room for improvement but still Rask is amazing. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems is Rask AI solving and how is that benefiting you?Rask allowed me to translate in English an Italian podcast in just 3 days. it was amazing.

Intuitive Interface: The user interface is sleek and user-friendly, allowing even the most technologically challenged individuals to navigate with ease. Selecting a new voice and tweaking parameters is as simple as a few clicks, and the real-time preview ensures you get the desired result.

Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about Rask AI?Subscription Cost: While the platform offers a free version with basic features, the premium subscription unlocks the full potential of VoiceMorph+. The cost might be a bit steep for casual users, but for avid linguists and content creators, the investment is undoubtedly worthwhile.

Resource Intensive: Running VoiceMorph+ on older devices might cause a strain on system resources. Users with less powerful hardware might experience lag or delays during voice generation.

"What do you like best about Rask AI?I'm a Canadian YouTuber who's always wanted to translate my content to the french language, as there's a huge french population in Canada. Although I speak french, refilming or redubbing the videos myself took countless hours, which simply wasn't worth it in the big picture. Now that A.I. has become more prevalent, I started looking for an automatic translation tool which is when I found Rask. 

I've used it on a couple of my videos to date, and have to say I'm quite impressed with the cloned voice feature. It does sound like me with more of a french accent, but does the job. I'm sure it'll get even better over time. Planning on using it for 3-4 videos per month to bring my french channel back to life without a huge time commitment.

Customer support has been helpful. I reached out about a couple of things and they helped me promptly. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about Rask AI?Although I'd love for Rask to be flawless, there are a couple of hiccups that I've found difficult to navigate. 

1. The translation to french is 95% there, but every once in a while, the ""french"" becomes incomprehensible. It sounds as if an english person is speaking terribly broken french, then it goes back to perfect speech. I tried changing the translated text in those areas, but it's quite finicky and seems to be caused by the root video itself, not the translation. I hope this gets better over time. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems is Rask AI solving and how is that benefiting you?Translating my English YouTube videos to French to reach a wider audience.

"What do you like best about Rask AI?I have used Rask AI to convert my english and hindi videos to French and it does the work wonderfully. The voice is very similar, it resembles the original voice also it is in sync with the video. Very difficult to differentiate between actual video and dubbed Rask AI version.

Its intuitive interface and advanced AI capabilities significantly reduce editing time while increasing creative potential. It's ideal for both beginners and professionals, streamlining the video production process and offering high-quality results. Highly recommended for anyone looking to enhance their video content Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about Rask AI?One major downside of Rask AI's video tool is its lip-syncing process. The need to first translate and then separately use the lip-sync mode is cumbersome. This two-step process doesn't happen simultaneously, causing delays and inefficiencies, particularly for multilingual content creators. It hampers the workflow, especially when working with different languages, making the tool less efficient in these scenarios Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems is Rask AI solving and how is that benefiting you?Rask AI is revolutionizing our approach to international business communication.

"What do you like best about Rask AI?I live in Costa Rica and as a Spanish speaker user I needed to have something quick to Dub my videos from English. I was imppressed on several things: 1-How easy and intuitive was, 2-How fast was the video Dubbing, 3-How accurate the translation was. But the most thing Iiked was the AI Voice Clonoing!! Thas was amazing. My video was Dubbed with the right voice and tone required!! I have tried pretty much everything on the market place for Dubbing and Translating and this was the best solution I found. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about Rask AI?The only thing I can mention is pricing. Maybe this can be more accessible from pricetag point of view. Still though, due to the quality of the final product I could not reject paying for it.

"What do you like best about Rask AI?For my specific need, the most helpfull feature is to edit the translaed transcript and beeing able to ReDub the video. Since I'm mainly dubbing interviews, sometime there are words or phrases that are only verbal fillings of the guest, and that for the accuracy of the message, can be discarted form the translated product.
Also the voice clonning feature is very accurate, that is great for delivering the content of a known guest, that people knows how their voice sounds, but before the translation, were unable to understand his or her words. Now they recognize the voice and understand the message. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about Rask AI?There are not many options of voices, when not using the voice-clonning feature.
I would really wish that the minute count was more accurate, and that 6:45 would not count as 7 minutes.

"What do you like best about Rask AI?Upon using the service, the first thing you'll notice is its incredibly user-friendly interface. It's intuitive, allowing even those with minimal technical expertise to navigate with ease. The process is as simple as uploading your video and selecting the desired language – the AI takes care of the rest.

The most impressive feature is the AI's ability to maintain the speaker's original voice while translating the content. This is a game-changer for online educators like myself  looking to reach a global audience without losing the authenticity of my voice. The result is a translation that feels personal and genuine, as if the speaker were fluent in the language of translation.

Moreover, the post-translation editing capability is a standout. The ability to tweak the translated text is a fantastic addition, but what truly sets this service apart is how these edits respect the original video's timing. This means that your message is delivered as intended, without awkward pauses or rushed speech.

The AI's attention to detail extends to the synchronization of subtitles and lip movements which is still in a test mode, but is already pretty fine, ensuring that the final product is not only heard but also seen as natural. This meticulousness is crucial for maintaining the immersive experience of the original video. I think with time it will get better as for now it's still in beta.


I really encourage anyone to try using this service. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about Rask AI?Firstly, the cost of the service is a significant factor. The technology is indeed cutting-edge, but the pricing structure may be prohibitive, especially for educators and professionals who regularly produce lengthy content. In a field where budgets can be tight, a more budget-friendly option would be greatly appreciated and would make this powerful tool more accessible to a broader audience.

Secondly, while the service operates smoothly for the most part, I have experienced occasional freezes at the beginning of videos. Although these hiccups are minor and not particularly disruptive, they do detract from the otherwise sleek user experience. In instances where first impressions are crucial, such as in educational content or professional presentations, even a small glitch can be somewhat off-putting. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems is Rask AI solving and how is that benefiting you?French being my first language, it was difficult for me to reach student from UK, US, etc. But with this tool, i have access to a bigger market.

I understand that the quality of RASK's translations comes at a cost, and I wholeheartedly appreciate the value it provides. Its accuracy, natural flow, and ability to handle specialized language are unmatched in the market. However, I believe that making RASK even more affordable would further enhance its appeal and allow more language learners to benefit from its exceptional capabilities.

I hope that the developers of RASK will continue to explore ways to make their tool even more accessible without compromising on quality.

"What do you like best about Rask AI?The user-friendly interface of Rask AI makes it easy for me to navigate and create multilingual versions of my content within minutes. The quality of the voice-over is exceptional, and it sounds remarkably natural, as if it were my own voice. This not only saves me the hassle of hiring third-party announcers but also ensures that the final result requires minimal editing.

One of the standout features of Rask AI is its affordability. The cost of using Rask AI is significantly lower compared to hiring a translator, announcer, and editor separately. Additionally, the time saved is invaluable, as I can now produce content in multiple languages without any delays.

I have primarily used Rask AI for dubbing my content into English, but I recently expanded to include Spanish as well. The results have been outstanding, and I'm impressed with how accurately Rask AI captures the emotions and nuances of the original audio track.

"What do you like best about Rask AI?Really practical tool for voice-over translation. We expand our businees operation to a set of new countries and use RaskAI extensively in order to translate promo videos to many different languages. Default transcription and translation work in 99% of the cases just out of the box, voice cloning works very well too. Ability to change time codes and insert new ones really helps us to synchronzie text to video, especially when speaker activelly moves or makes gestures.

In the RaskAI generated lip-sync fake motions of lips, nose and especially chin where very obvious and not really synchronzied to each other.

"What do you like best about Rask AI?A great tool for translating from hearing. 
The app hears all the words from the uploaded material and automatically translates them into any language - the number of languages to choose from is really impressive. Best of all - you can make changes to the text and timecode on the fly - both in the transcription and in the translation, so the end result is exactly as you dream it to be. In addition, choosing from a database of voices is very easy, and if you don't like any of them - there's always the cloning option. I can't wait to see what capabilities rask.app will have in a few months' time. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about Rask AI?As in the case of image generation, there is still some time to go before the generated sound actually conveys the creator's intended intent. The only downside for the moment is the inability to control emotion and intention, add pauses and suspend the voice. Although the project I am working on in the app is based on finished material with emotions in the voice, unfortunately it does not translate them into the final dubbing result. The output material is devoid of emotion, loses the intention from the original, and is in no way controllable. It is simply quite flat. I think it's only a matter of time before the algorithm learns to read emotion and context or intent. If you have a simple topic to do where emotions are not important - go ahead and use it, because overall the app works great.

"What do you like best about Rask AI?I create content in my native language. And I had experience interacting with a translator and announcer to create my content in another language. This required time, effort and expense to translate the text, then voice-over it and subsequent editing, which was necessary to cut out unsuccessful takes and give it the correct form. Rask AI allows me to save all this effort and literally in a few minutes produces a ready-made version that practically does not require editing, and is also voiced not by a third-party announcer, but by my voice, which sounds absolutely natural. This is an amazing result. The service interface is very simple and clear, the price is more than affordable. The costs of a translator, announcer and editor would be much more expensive. And most importantly, it would take more time. Previously, I only dubbed content into English, but Rask AI allowed me to add Spanish as well.

It has way better features at a more mature and stable stage and is ultra-easy to use. I was producing translations and using the tools with little effort. I love that the price is more competitive than other services, considering the amount of features they offer.

"What do you like best about Rask AI?I have been using Rask AI for a while with the free version. For this, I created several accounts but decided on the paid version and, honestly, I was pleasantly surprised. Not only is it super easy to use and has a design that I love, but the functionalities are impressive. The part about cloning the voice and adapting the lips realistically is something I had never seen and it has me fascinated. It is definitely one of the best apps I have tried in a long time.After experimenting with several (well-known) apps, the ease of implementation of Rask AI is simply unmatched. Incorporating it into my daily projects has been a smooth and uncomplicated process, now I am working on several projects for TEST and technical explanations about product use. The platform seems to be designed with the user in mind so the UX is very well thought out, eliminating the technical barriers you often find in other tools.

"What do you like best about Rask AI?This tool saved me so much time because I don't have to record my videos again just to support customers that speak another language. I'm also really looking forwards to the lip-synching functionality. The fact that you can review the script before starting the dubbing process also makes for a better translation. Moreover, most of the settings are set for you by using AI as well, saving you time and allowing you to focus on bringing value instead of fiddling around with parameters. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about Rask AI?The only downside that I noticed is that the dubbed videos are a bit monotonic, but I don't see it as a dealbreaker. Hopefully the dubbed voice will improve in the future, as this technology is relatively new.

"What do you like best about Rask AI?When a video is uploaded within the program, its ability to list the audio text with timestamps is excellent. The translations are largely helpful. Being able to translate a video that has been loaded with music and sound effects is very impressive. In the end, it can deliver voices without music or SFX. It can also be used just to extract speech texts. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about Rask AI?The areas that need improvement or where I struggled are as follows: Sometimes, it has difficulty recognizing voices and attributes different voices to a single character. Of course, this can be easily corrected as you can select who will voice the text in the list. The issue I couldn't find a solution for is that sometimes voices from the same person come out differently, even the female voice sounding like a male at times. It also doesn't capture sounds like surprise or sadness and doesn't add them to the character. When we add these sounds to the text, it can sound a bit artificial.  While there may be some challenges for animations, overall, it is a very successful program. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems is Rask AI solving and how is that benefiting you?We were experiencing difficulties in translating our created films into different languages. We had trouble finding voice actors, and the ones we found were expensive. Additionally, voiceovers were taking at least 2-3 days to be delivered. With Rask AI, we can instantly translate our films with the voices we choose. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.",4.0,2023-10-12,Huseyin O.

Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about Rask AI?There are two things I would change and they are the possibility to make searches within the transcription or translation and to improve the automatic translations with the possibility to make changes in some words in a similar way as DeepL does with its own dictionaries to make the translations more consistent.

"What do you like best about Rask AI?The translation of audio is nearly fantastic. There were just a few little errors. 

Also, the speech generation is very fluent and realistic. The voice clone is indistinguishable from the real voice. 

I liked the way you can modify and adapt the translated text, before generating the video. There is also a nice feature that warns you, if translated text is too long to be dubbed optimally. Even more it offers an AI way to adjust those too long texts. 

The process is quite easy, upload a video, specify number of speakers, original language and target language (number of speakers and original language can also be detected automatically) and submit. Afterward uploading you can modify the proposed text. You can then start generating the video.

Rask.Ai offers lip-syncing in a beta version, which does not cost extra. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about Rask AI?Sometimes the dubbed version is too slow or too fast. It is not really disturbing, but if you know the original video, you find the differences in speed.
The largest disadvantage is the lip-syncing. This is stated to be in beta, so they are honest about that. But it really is a beta. The artificial mouth looks unnatural and not like the real original mouth. Furthermore, the mouth jitters in its position. You can obviously see that this is a fake mouth. Other tools are way better with this. But we have to wait until this feature comes out of beta, I am sure it will be much enhanced.

"What do you like best about Rask AI?Después de utilizar Rask AI durante un periodo considerable con la versión gratuita, finalmente opté por la versión de pago y debo decir que estoy encantado con los resultados. Esta plataforma ha superado mis expectativas en todos los sentidos. No solo es extremadamente fácil de usar, sino que su diseño es simplemente encantador. Las capacidades que ofrece son impresionantes.

La función de clonar la voz y sincronizar los labios de manera realista es algo que nunca había visto antes y me ha dejado fascinado. Después de probar varias aplicaciones bien conocidas, puedo decir con certeza que la facilidad de implementación de Rask AI es insuperable. Integrarlo en mis proyectos diarios ha sido un proceso sin complicaciones, y ahora estoy trabajando en varios proyectos para crear pruebas y explicaciones técnicas sobre el uso de productos.

La plataforma parece estar diseñada teniendo en mente al usuario, lo que se refleja en una experiencia de usuario excepcional. Se eliminan las barreras técnicas que a menudo se encuentran en otras herramientas, lo que ha permitido que mi experiencia sea no solo placentera, sino también altamente productiva. Gracias a Rask, puedo aprovechar al máximo la aplicación sin perder tiempo en complejidades innecesarias. Sin duda, esta es una de las mejores aplicaciones que he probado en mucho tiempo y la recomiendo encarecidamente. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about Rask AI?Aunque Rask AI ofrece una amplia gama de características innovadoras y una experiencia de usuario generalmente fluida, he notado que en ocasiones la precisión de la sincronización labial puede ser un poco irregular. En ciertas circunstancias, la coincidencia entre la voz y los movimientos labiales puede no ser completamente realista, lo que puede resultar un tanto distractor para el espectador.

Por otro lado, tampoco me acaba de convecer que las opciones para traducción al español sean todas ellas al  español de latinoamerica, y no peninsular o neutro.

The price is quite high, almost as much as the minimum wage for the highest model in Turkey. The current cheap packages do not allow us much trial and error. It doesn't always work perfectly, sometimes manual adjustments are needed. This is especially difficult to adjust manually in videos with many speakers. Not all important features work correctly.

"What do you like best about Rask AI?Ideal for dubbing a film, it improves quality and especially saves considerable time in postproduction, film and documentary dubbing. I made a documentary film with a French team, The Revelation of the Pyramids 2, which is the second part of a set of 7 documentary films with a philosophical, scientific, and mathematical character, centered around an emblematic figure of the 19th Century; the first part of The Revelation of the Pyramids reached about 993 million views thanks to the Internet and television.I had the ambition for the second opus, ""The Revelation of the Pyramids, the tilted equator"" to release it in several languages. Being a small structure without financial means, I turned to AI. RASK meets all my needs for translation and cloning of the voice-over and interviews in 130 different languages.It's an opportunity I do not regret, the software is very efficient and RASK AI has a solid team to help you finalize your projects. There is even the possibility to clone voice segments from French to French to correct sound recording defects.The documentary is 1H44 long and there are many numbers and mathematical formulas, referencing scientists. To date, the AI has presented only a few problems in resolving this project. Problems quickly resolved with the RASK team. The first draft is 99% satisfactory, depending on the situations.The documentary contains 12 different voices over 12 chapters and potentially in 10 languages to translate. Possibly more. Therefore, it is necessary to remain very precise in timing, speech rate, and diction, which the RASK AI manages very well.The documentary contains a lot of mathematics and scientific terms, which it reproduces very accurately in terms of meaning. It is a very reliable material whose possibilities I have not yet fully tested. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about Rask AI?Acceleration of the voice.
